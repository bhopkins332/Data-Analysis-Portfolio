# Brandon Hopkins - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Brandon! I have a technical background with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan - Go Blue! I worked for 6+ years as a design engineer for automotive suppliers, focusing primarily on high speed / high frequency connection systems. I was also part of an advanced development group that worked on R&D and business improvement projects; it was through those experiences that I first was introduced to data analytics! Since then, I have turned interest into action and am working to pivot my career from Engineering to Data Analytics by taking online courses, connecting with professionals, practicing new skills, and completing projects. 

This is a repository to showcase skills and share what I have done in the world of Data Analytics. 

## Projects

### 2014 Michigan Basketball Analysis
- Data analysis and visualization project in which I analyzed shooting statistics and created an interactive dashboard for the 2014 Michigan Men's basketball team that won the Big Ten Conference championship.
- Data was accessed via a SQL query of a public database on Big Query; dashboard was created via Power BI.
- The clear takeaway from this analysis is that field goal percentage has a great impact on overall performance, and when the 2014 Wolverines shot over 43% on any given day, they were heavily favored to win the game.

### Chelsea FC Transfer Analysis
- Data analysis and visualization project completed using Power BI that analyzes transfer market data of my favorite soccer team, Chelsea FC, from 2015-2018.
- Imported data from an online transfer mareket database (https://www.transfermarkt.us/) into Power BI, cleaned data via Power Query and created measures with DAX expressions.
- Created individual reports for each season, as well as a dashboard combining all seasons.
- There are countless factors that impact Premier League performance over the course of a season, however the takeaway from this limited study is that the team performed better in the league in years that both the net spend and average age of incoming transfers were higher. This makes sense, as a more expensive and/or older player typically has more ability (hence the higher fee) or brings more experience to the team.

### Linkedin Connection Data Visualization
- Quick and fun data visualization project using Tableau to create a dashboard from profile data extracted from Linkedin.
- The most interesting takeaway from the dashboard is the total connections vs time plot, which visualizes how I have been more active on Linkedin (making more connections) at times when I was either considering or actively looking for a new opportunity.
- The dashboard can be viewed on my Tableau Public profile here: https://public.tableau.com/views/LinkedinConnectionsDashboard/LinkedinDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

### Better Call Saul Word Cloud
- Fun way to analyze one of my favorite shows! Imported transcript data from a screenplay database (https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=205) of Better Call Saul's S6E3 to see which words were used the most in the episode.
