# Brandon Hopkins - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Brandon! I have a technical background with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan - Go Blue! I worked for 6+ years as a design engineer for automotive suppliers, focusing primarily on high speed / high frequency connection systems. I was also part of an advanced development group that worked on R&D and business improvement projects; it was through those experiences that I first was introduced to data analytics! Since then, I have transitioned into becoming a Data Analyst by taking online courses, connecting with professionals, practicing new skills, and completing projects. 

This is a repository to showcase skills and share what I have done in the world of Data Analytics.

## Projects

### Linkedin Connection Data Visualization
- Quick and fun data visualization project using Tableau to create a dashboard from profile data extracted from Linkedin
- The most interesting takeaway from the dashboard is the total connections vs time plot, which visualizes how I have been more active on Linkedin (making more connections) at times when I was either considering or actively looking for a new opportunity
- The dashboard can be viewed on my Tableau Public profile here: https://public.tableau.com/views/LinkedinConnectionsDashboard/LinkedinDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
